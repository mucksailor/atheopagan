Assassin's Creed III is an impossible game, veiled in shadow and unseen by the cultural periphery. Such is the fate of many great works, concealed from the evanescent gaze of tempus praesentis. This fate calls to mind Frank Herbert's 'Dune' — crafted by a hippie left-wing Republican, an archetype lost in the whisper of the ages: Suffering crude critiques that liken it to 'fascism' or suggest it was concerned with political Islam well before its meteoric rise. Some stories are too eternal to catch the beating pulse of their time. What progressive today could truly hear the ancient song of anarchism as this game does? Who among them would dare critique the Revolution’s shattered bones while still cradling its sublime soul? And which soul, in this age, would envision a Native American protagonist as more than a mere marionette of identity politics?

The present moment is a canvas streaked with the ashen grey of crumbling empires. Yet, amid this decay, golden veins of liberty glint like treasure buried beneath centuries of dust. For a glorious instant, we stood on the precipice, traversing a path where the anti-hierarchical reign of colour-blind liberalism glimmered with its ephemeral dawn. Equality had not yet become a tally mark, a ledger to be settled through the calculating eyes of bureaucrats. Now, we find ourselves drowning in the abyss — an ocean of soulless egotists, their shallow reflections rippling through every institution, as the light of political Eden flickers and fades. Assassin’s Creed III remains one of its final, dying embers, glowing faintly in a world too drenched in narcissism to care.

A fervent advocate of liberty deeply rooted in the sacred soil of America, Connor harbours a vision extending far beyond the forest canopies of his people. His journey, as so many do, begins in the fires of revenge — blinded by grief, hunting the spectre of the Templars across the wreckage of history. Yet, as the flames of his fury subside, they reveal something sharper, colder: a justice unclouded by personal vendetta. Like Ezio before him, Connor transforms into an instrument — merciless and precise, his blade cutting not from rage but necessity. He learns to kill as an automaton would clear debris. Templars must fall, not because they wounded him, but because their ideals are a poison spreading through the land. 'Ah,' says the Templar, with the arrogance of one lost in myriad self-delusions, 'I acted with good intentions as I crushed them beneath my heel.' But their righteousness is pitiful in its hollow grandeur. Are they not pathetic?

This title is too liberal, too universalist for our era. We hear echoes of 'colonialism' as defined by revanchists: for even when the Revolutionaries betray him, Connor remains steadfast in his political faith. His vision transcends tribe and custom, emerging from the darkness cast by the shadow domain — as a true avatar of liberty. A Robespierrian figure, whose loyalty lies not in men but in an ideal too pure for the weak to comprehend. Nothing could be more terrifying: his march is that of liberty’s chains coming for wretches and kings alike. To those without dreams, it appears as madness. As Charles Lee notes, 'Those who know you think you mad, and this is why. Even those men you sought to save have turned their backs on you. Yet you resist. You fight. Why?' With desperation and unwavering conviction, Connor delivers the killing blow upon his pistol, his voice cold and fatalistic as he fires: 'Because no one else will.'

As Altair once said to King Richard I, 'We are who we choose to be.' Is Connor writing letters and petitioning for #landback? Does he beg for financial reprieve over all the wrongs he has suffered? No. He practices real politics; he embodies direct action. The 'Tyranny of George Washington' DLC visually deletes Lord Acton's famous quote into: 'Power corrupts absolutely.' This is no accident. Gone is the 'balance' that later games would champion, the cynical centrism. The first three Assassin’s Creed titles are imbued with the breath of anarchy. Their portrayal of governance-as-disorder casts a scorching light on the masks of authority. For this third title, the very structure of land ownership is depicted as another mask for exploitation. As the epilogue reveals, land pre-emption was cynically used in place of taxation, which, if introduced too soon, would stoke rebellion. 'It is too… British.' Early-game missions see tax collectors meet their scarlet end, casting their role as thoroughly vile, emblematic of the state's wretched designs. Could such a narrative be penned by a progressive today? Would they grasp the free-market roots embodied by figures like Adam Smith, Thomas Hodgskin, Benjamin Tucker, Proudhon, and the like? Certainly not. They would only lament that people are not beaten into paying their fair share. Like all Ralwsians, they fail to understand: liberty, equality, fraternity.

Connor, however, sees these ideals with striking clarity. He finds himself in constant conflict, not just with his Templar father, Haytham, but with every ally he dares to trust. For him, no amount of liberty is ever sufficient. The Revolution must sweep away governments, class divisions, slavery; everything that bears the mark of oppression. As Connor observes, liberty granted in pieces or as selective favours only distorts its true meaning, corrupting the arc of freedom until it becomes something lesser, something hollow. And do we not see this today? How can we call ourselves free when we are bound by mass surveillance and a labyrinth of legal restrictions — shaped by the technocratic impulse to mould citizens into compliant, artificial servants for corporatocracy? Connor stands in harmony with Louis-Auguste Blanqui’s liberal vision: that nature itself stands as the arbiter of all discord. Should we resist surrendering to the vast cosmos, we merely cultivate strife and bitter decay. To wield dominion over the world is to be shamed by the gaze of eternity.

As the silhouette of Connor’s quest fades into nothingness, his relentless pursuit of the unblemished Ideal communicates a profound challenge. His tale is not confined to the annals of fictional history but reaches into our vital souls, calling us to answer the creeds reflected in our eyes. His unwavering spirit stands as a sober reminder of the strength and rigour needed to live by one's convictions, inviting us to look beyond wretched contentment and face the raw essence of our values.
