# Destruction and Bliss

*I’ll never let your insignificance, your substandard ego
Subvert my own resolve and dedication
I’ll never take on your indecision and have no backbone
I forever choose destruction and bliss!*
(**S. God Is An Automaton:** ***Destruction And Bliss***)

**Regulated delusion**. Have you been outside lately? A thunderstorm is brewing. Nature is swerving and swaying in its purest form: elemental chaos. Lightning strikes the unlucky ones — this is a trivial fact — and we rightfully accept this as an inevitable product of nature. How have we come to see ourselves as so distinct from the world that we cannot accept similar facts about ourselves: ***as forces of nature?*** The only means to resolve crime and disorder in society is through the acceptance that there is no such resolution — by ***absolving*** it. For there will always be a clash of values between the accepted and those outcast, it is forever open to dispute whether any action is a crime in the extra-legal sense. The prevailing order is invariably open to ever-extending branches of questions: whether it constitutes a genuine form of order, whether its standards are just, whether orderliness is preferable at all, etc. A culture cannot stagnate and calcify into a final form — into one eternal code of law. Not only is this physically impossible but if it ever came to pass, we would be seeing the signs of a sick and decaying society. A society that stops becoming and evolving, this is a synonym for ***rigor mortis***. Away with the shrouds that blind us to the reality before us: we necessarily live dangerously even in our surest and most artificial comforts. Just as one individual would be deemed unwell to live in a perpetual state of anxiety about things one cannot control, thus can we diagnose a government or society as a whole. The ***vitality*** that we ***feel*** in our momentary existence is degraded and debased when we hide inside our many caves, whether physical or moral.

**Dread and wonder**. Once spoke Nietzsche: “… the path to one’s own heaven always leads through the voluptuousness of one’s own hell.” We live entangled in a strange web of forcefully disparate emotions. There is a lie the consciousness tells itself about its infinitely fine-grained states: I felt ***this*** or ***that*** at such a time. Any meditation or innocent witnessing of an emotion reveals your mental state to be a depthless impression of overlapping auras: the gradient that distinguishes pleasure and pain — for example — blurs together when the subject stops imposing a higher-level order and thereby a much deeper disorder of affects ***tainted by foreground consciousness*** on a lower-level. This psychological mistake extends from the purely subjective sphere into other realities: we avoid struggle, conflict, dissonance, and difference as if they were sharply distinct from the pleasurable goods instinctively sought. As persons, as groups, and as entire cultures — we miss our targets by misidentifying them. The dangerous exhilaration an adrenaline junkie feels is simply an exaggerated variation of the emotional-tonal variety ***all*** of us need to feel satisfied.

***The doomsday party***. Eventually death turns it gaze toward each and every one of us. Adrenaline is like a fuel of gasoline bound to run out and, as it does, the taste of dust becomes unbearably strong. Many of us squander our existence in predictable ways, fuelled by a dual-pattern that slides one way or the other at any given point in our lives: either we fail to work toward the future or we let our anticipation of the future hinder our ability to enjoy the present moment. Maintaining the delicate balance between ***planning to live*** and ***actually living*** is incredibly important but even more difficult. As a culture, we are far from well-equipped to arm individuals with the physical and mental forms of knowledge they need to reap the fruits of life. Maladaptation is the prevailing norm.

*You shut your mouth so you don’t have to take sides
There’s nothing left for trying to please everyone
You did engage in your their low place shadow play
You feel the heat of what is burning deep inside*
(**SD. Digital Divide:** *Omega Point*)

*And this is how we realize the tragic price of wasting time
It doesn’t make sense if we die
And don’t know in the end if we truly lived*
(**S. The Pulse Of Awakening:** *Doomsday Party*)

**Creation and destruction**. In a poetically synchronous relationship with the universe itself, our civilizations are locked into cycles of destruction and creation. All that surrounds us will turn to ashes and dust in even the best possible futures. We don’t need to endure a climate apocalypse to see everything we’ve built crumble and collapse. A vulgar summation of the universe: motion and entropy. ***Everything*** is temporary but the false need to feel eternal deludes us about the precise character of this fact. Our dark desire for eternality is an indirect wish for stagnation — a far more permanent death. The physical and social aspects of entropy ensure the healthy dynamism required for lives worth living and futures worth building. A sudden cessation of this playful impression of the natural world on our lives is, beyond the surface, not desirable in the way our initial presumptions would have it.

*We believe to be eternal until we face the point of no return
All state of grace is transient
All shall die and turn to ashes and dust
Desacralized, desensitized
We chasing the light just wishing to live a little more
It’s like a hole inside our chest
A clear cut bleeding, always open wide*
(**S. The Pulse Of Awakening:** *Meridian A.D.*)

**Struggle and sacrifice**. To experience the nauseating paralysis of anxiety yet eventually overcome it! Such events are the true spices of life. We naturally misvalue the first sequences of struggle in favour of their end results. When all is said and done, we feel glad that the initial bouts of pain and sorrow are over — but fail to appreciate their presence in the first place. This is one of our greatest mistakes. Have you ever looked back upon a difficult experience with aesthetic wonder for the narrative value it has painted over your existence? You should try doing it, if not. To affirm, at every moment, ***all*** the pains and pleasures your hardest endeavours deliver you… ***this*** would be a potent tonic for far greater feats of power than you have heretofore been capable of achieving.

*To reach the apex of life is to walk in a vale of tears
Heavens still remain out of sight wherever we watch
To reach the apex of life is to walk in a vale of tears
We shine to finally dissolve in oblivion and be absolved through death*
(**S. The Pulse Of Awakening:** *Meridian A.D.*)

**Undermining ourselves**. What do we seek at bottom? Certainly not happiness. If we valued happiness, we would have stayed relatively content ***though stagnant*** along the model provided by the early Inca civilization. To define your life in virtue of attaining happiness not only harms yourself but shrouds your vision — your ability to observe the true conditions of life. Misery, sickness, and debasement are the normal states of being for animals of all types throughout the entirety of history. As higher animals with the ability to reflect upon this fact, we keep pressing onward: suicide is statistically rare. How is this the case? I posit here our insatiable will-to-purpose. Purpose redeems the exquisite suffering and agony we endure in life, both in its pursuit and obtainment. Unfortunately this is all too easily corrupted for numerously dark projects that are continuously unleashed upon the Earth. The State — the greatest of all institutional monsters — is almost artistic with its ability to exploit our will-to-purpose. Subservience and obedience fulfills it immediately, and there are many pathways provided to just end this end! Whether through military service fuelled by tribal-nationalistic propaganda or urban development schemes, it really does not matter. The exact content of its goals are volatile and ultimately irrelevant for our psychological satisfaction. Authority hijacks our drive toward self-overcoming by promising an easy path upon which many burdens are distributed and specialized among a field of ‘othered’ beings: higher up to those ascending to hierarchical positions of power (their ***excess*** of purpose) and down to labouring masses who feel themselves, as tools, working toward horizons others have defined for them. Collective purpose: a pervasive blight upon human beings-of-becoming. ***The mere pursuit of happiness*** has infinite value for monsters of pride that rule over others, for in a historical sense it is virtually a synonym for ***contentment with the reigning order of things***.

**Spiritual over sociopolitical hierarchies**. A human-being develops toward mediocrity ***at their best*** in the usual case. Through an unfortunate mixture of lacking many talents and the ability to utilize any worthwhile capacities they possess, most people fail to stand out from the collective mirage. Plausible origin behind the error of authority: a careless transmission of the judgement that one human type is more spiritually significant than others ***as being their justification for wielding power over others***. No inference is more more dangerous than this one. For opponents of authority are likely to minimize the qualitative distances between types of people, thereby giving false credence to authoritarian half-beings who sanctify interpersonal hierarchies by merely restating what was just denied. What Nietzsche identified as a case of ***ressentiment*** among anarchists is more likely a faulty dialectical move: to outright deny the privileged abilities of those most likely to obtain power — as a matter of strategy.

**To affirm your own desolation**. To playfully yank on the threads tying you to the natural universe, determined to make a puppet out of your personal humanity. To take pleasure in that which you control and cannot control. To laugh in the face of death — to weather the storm of this fearful life. To draw a straight line across the peaks and valleys of your emotional sierra: your persistence; your alleyway of health. To move between devastation and exhilaration as if they were one continuous state of mind. To knock on the doors of your distorted impressions that hide the self from yourself, never expecting an answer. To create your own answers to all questions. To physically disintegrate as you discover new terrains of living littered with the tears of your numerous experiences. To forever choose destruction and bliss!

*Bursting flames of freedom covet a new sanity
Overflowing wounds that marked this mortal frame
Lacerations abound in the prism of my soul
Bleeding exhortations that demand liberation
My chosen serendipity
A final gesture towards autonomy*
