# High Tech; Low Life

*Kali Yuga
And we slowly turn into cowards
The excess of truth isolates us
Forsaken, dismayed
We’re told to mask the void inside our disabled hearts
In subtle ways
Substitute faceless
We’re dissolved into a sea of grey
Constrained to settle for decay*
(**S. God Is An Automaton:** *Hightech Versus Lowlife*)

**A taste of urban freedom**. One does not have to be a political reactionary to see a pressing problem before us: social atomization is intensifying as a genuine sociopolitical, moral, and otherwise basic public health issue; with it comes tangible threats to our at least faux liberal values. People yearn for the taste of freedom from rigid customs, collective tyrannies, the spiritually boring nature of mere contentment and lazy comforts, yet find the consequences of liberation intolerable. Instead of attempting to become more, to adapt to our environment, we are drowning under waters that we ourselves enthusiastically dived into, screaming at the deep void as our lungs fill with our ‘destination’ — forgetting that we took this leap of faith for intractably good reasons. Whether the storm of consequences or stay out of the race entirely. Beating the drums of progress may often be a blind act — purposed toward building bridges toward nowhere — but progress has no patience and certainly lacks a worthy foe. Due to hyperactive reactions by various guilty factions, ***now*** Christianity is viable threat to civilization once more; now neo-”pagan” ideas have cultural relevance; now we are on the verge of not learning a single thing from ‘the death of god’. Redirect your ***reaction*** and reflect upon truly modern ways to solve modern issues. Following either the past or an overly long arc of the future are not projects geared toward meaningful ***development***: we still, after all, are fighting the war for baseline liberalism. The King’s head was never collected, not truly, and the human spirit cannot even begin to rest until it is done — the moral revolution thoroughly and absolutely executed.

*We were blind and we couldn’t conceive the colour of blood
This crimson flood soaking the ground
We stare in shock as the world unveils its true features to us
You then exclaim, ‘where is God now?’*
(**S. God Is An Automaton:** *God Is An Automaton*)

**The danger of who speaks first**. To over-react, to over-correct in response to a perceived enemy’s dialectical game is just to debase yourself in the end. Far too often do activists grant unnecessary premises for their opponents: race realism for example becomes bad not just because it’s fool-headed and wrong, but because it ***must*** be wrong — by false inference — that if it were correct, our anti-racist commitments would be undermined. Nothing could be further from the truth. It may be tempting to get in the grit and detail of fascistic views, but the fascistic speaker rarely cares about the truth. You are dealing with a self-unaware troll by nature. One should not simply grant stipulated normative entailments for such opponents.

*A mass of emptied minds, docile imitators
We never try to see the light, corrupted to the core we are
Breeding in the vacuum, our words are useless noise
Automaton chained to common patterns, so inane
Fuck now: adaptable, manipulated, you consume and then you’re erased
Shit, submit to system pressure, programmed to never deviate*
(**S. Slave Design:** *Decoy*)

**To prioritize the qualities of life over life itself**. A manifestly unfair play is made by those who are dealing with the latest expression of sickness — the general sickness that we must all overcome — during our beloved pandemic. Three east asian cultures, one of them an island, have ‘flattened’ the curve through hyper-utilitarian production of PPE and norms strongly enforced on state and cultural levels. We westerns are far too different for that, it is our virtue as much as it is our own destruction. For people who hear the word ***biopower*** uttered frequently, the same parties involved seem woefully blind to differences in how disparate cultures respond to it. Calls for the arms of the state are made to maximize PPE-clip production, with no consideration for who is demanding them in the first place. The unreason of ‘command economy thinking’ plagues us still.

*Regulated delusion as logical solution*
(**S. Antares:** *Technocracy*)

**Rigid values facing an open mind**. How could I conceive myself to be an intellectually honest person if I’m open to everything but a rigid field of anarchistic values — which are inclusive of intellectual honesty itself — such that I cannot seriously question them due to ***who I am***? For those interested in the image of a dry, serious, scientific, naturalistic, and ultimately passionless philosopher publishing article-spam after article-spam, the following idea may seem absurd: ***one’s epistemology should not violate who they are***. Such a principle hardly seems likely to be maximally conducive to the epistemic goals of gaining truth and avoiding error, but that’s neither the whole point of philosophy generally nor epistemology more narrowly. Call attention to the fact that much has been written about epistemology, that histories of epistemology are available, and a substantial body of is literature is available for all to pirate or request. What can be revealed about ourselves by studying patterns in the history of epistemology? Even if we stipulate that epistemology has no independent value whatsoever, we still have access to how other cultures and thematically defined time capsules of our own cultures have conceived and executed anything resembling ‘the study of knowledge’. This kind of awareness is, of course, still demanded by the epistemic goals of obtaining truth and avoiding error.

*I start to realize the limitation of my attempts to truly understand the misery of man
The more I look inside, the more I’m prone to deride the basis of every creed:
“To know is to be saved”*
(**S. God Is Automaton:** ***No Wisdom Brings Solace***)

**The electrical storm**. Our generation is destined to be a collective blood sacrifice to the future, while this transitory stage damages many as our all-too-conservative cultures fail to flexibly adapt to the changes around us. It’s a far cry from the world our foredemons thought we’d inherit. Yet instead of screaming about how easier people had it in a previous time capsule of capitalism, we should be attending to our spiritual lives more than anything else. Deprivation is a natural condition of the world and, regardless of your economic views, the prevailing order is not going to be abolished on any given new year’s day. Why not first fight your enemies within — to then fight from within?

**The dynamic current**. ‘Dual power’ cry my fellow anarchists, but they do not consider a dual power strategy with regard to introspective psychology and direct action. Saul Newman, at the very least, touches on this in a vividly important way. In his resurrected and redemptive reading of Stirner, we are all participating in a deeper voluntary servitude that sustains the structures of coercion we see today. We must be ***psychological*** anarchists if we are going to be political and spiritual anarchists. If your means do not reflect your ideal world — do not even bother. The path to liberty is not littered with the ***literal*** blood of tyrants, only the bleeding out of what they once were, now redeemed as fully realized human beings-of-becoming.

**Action-free redemption**. Anarchism is destined to capitulate to many authoritarian games and shadow plays so long as activity is over-emphasized. ‘Anger is a gift’, yes, until it wipes the ideals out of your neurological circuits and replaces it with neurotic participation in the ongoing cycle of atrocity and revenge. We debate over the anarchistic legitimacy of polycentric legal orders, we steelman old practices like exile, ostracism, blacklisting, and ***bullying*** — instead of truly looking forward, as the true children of liberalism, as the most modern of moderns, to an entirely new framework to guide our path. ‘Burn down the master’s house using the master’s tools’ you say, but now your hands are scorched in the act. What will be spoiled by your blackened touch forever afterwards, by your brief taste for self-destructive ***mastery*** — have you even asked yourselves this?

**Active pacifism**. Do you think the purest pacifism can cause no damage, no violence, no suffering, enact no resistance to the barbarians that would fulfill their cruel desires? We can all draw images of the future in our minds, here is one: hyper-determined bodies chasing down their lords of randomized insanity. Fluidly organized and discursive acts of non-resistance to violent pressure, if enacted boldly enough, in great enough numbers, is an impossible force to defeat. ‘Death is the winner in any war’ — until death itself is no consequence. Economic globalism has made this approach all the more viable: you cannot kill nearly everyone, not even to fulfill the darkest desires — in some people, if we can call them that, the darkest ***needs*** — without economic catastrophe. Therefore without loss of power and domination over others, their true motivations. This has always been the case in a very tragic sense, but the consequences — and we are ruled by implicit utilitarians — mean so much more today. ***Modern problems demand modern solutions***.

*We are condemned to fail and to ruin our very lives
To endure through denial
We could let the world burn and watch each other die
Consternation keeps us unconcerned
With enforced discipline, we but forfeit our very pride
We require low sustenance:
To be keep entertained, to feel secure and feed
Deprivation is our single fear*
(***S. God Is An Automaton:*** *Downfall Inc*)

**A conservative movement that conceives itself as rebellious**. A dinosaur institution is largely captured by left-leaning ideologies, therefore leftists are in power in the western world in a meaningful sense. This conclusion is absurd just as ***young*** conservatives are stupid: I do not doubt there is a bias against conservatives in academia; I do not doubt that conservatives are also among the least intelligent members of academia. Just as the internally frustrating dynamics in our social justice causes largely consist in mediocre minds spamming mantras at each other and overwhelming dissent with the strength of numbers, to be a ***young*** conservative requires a remarkably anti-inquisitive and submissive intellect. ***Creative*** fluid intelligence is under-emphasized with regard to its importance: people place themselves into degrading data-automaton roles while lacking the capacity to utilize the information patterns they are otherwise expected to weave. Field specialization lets us hammer down specific issues within easily shared intra-disciplinary norms, but then those norms stick, become rigid, and necessary philosophical reflections on the field itself is dismissed as radical or fundamentally non-serious. At least until the right figure, at the right time, holds a mirror up to their faces. ***When is your replication crisis arriving***?

**Overcoming misanthropy**. Collective abuse leads to all-too-harsh judgements of individuals. The allied forces hypocritically screaming ***you did this*** to even innocent German citizens; culture war dichotomies that lack appropriate fine-grained attention; individuals reacting to types of people who harm them the most and judging all future instances of anyone who resembles that type reflexively. ***This*** individual in particular. It is easy to hate people when most people you meet want to imprison you in some way, to some cause, whether to school, to wage slavery, to careerism, to consumerism, to solidarity, to purpose, to non-moral ‘obligations’. Passionate emotions aside, there is no logic to be found in this reaction: once it is identified, it should be discarded. Yet it is not easy as that, is it? Misanthropy is never just learned, but deeply learned — always profoundly ingrained. To fight against misanthropy is to fight against your psychological destiny. It is fortunate, then, that rules are meant to be broken, that prophecy is always treacherous, and the beauty of chaos still fights against order — ***cannot*** stop fighting against order. Settled judgements are a kind of order that must be checked, must be subject to the harsh anarchist judgement of the soul, to remain true to yourself. How bad are the various people who have bent over backwards to accommodate your needs, really? How many guardian angel events has this Gab-unit witnessed in their lifespan? What is misanthropy if not everything you criticize in others: making unjustifiable inferences from limited pools of experience. Your hypocrisy is exposed — will you do anything with it? Time will tell you when its due, and no sooner, no matter what you have to say about it today.

*To walk among the human herd
To see the mark of our degeneration
Stagnant and dazed, we but relent
To break the strain of our self-enforcing schemes
Now our future is tantamount to past:
A dead-end race with a leaning for despise
Immobilism: our final goal
With corrupt bodies free to assume all control*
