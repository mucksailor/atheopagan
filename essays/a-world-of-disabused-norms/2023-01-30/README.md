# A World of Disabused Norms

*Let my neural circuits display the judgement
That was rewired beyond your norms
Your fragile values are but pretense
Pale imitations of dissidence
Liberation from soulless machinery begins
At the point of sheer dismay
A scorching sacrament to exorcise all obedience*
( — **WMC. Noise Amidst Cosmic Silence:** *Divided Spirit* | self/tbr)

**Can you taste the poison in the air**? Everyone is a brand interested in self-promotion above all else. Welcome to the age of networking. They chase clout not only to fulfill their vanity, but as a means of accumulating resources. Friendship itself has become commodified. Even the simplest careers increasingly call for this sociopathic approach to human connection. Chameleons rule the game. A nice conversation at the coffee shop delivers intrinsic value to us social animals, but today it plays the role of establishing ***connections*** — with less ***connection***. People are animate safety nets. That ***friend*** you can barely tolerate may be ***useful*** in the future.

Never express yourself directly. Social capital is too precious to burn carelessly. Don’t stand out — better yet, stand out ***in the right ways***. Always wear a mask. Bury your ego under the weight of carefully met expectations.

*From the very beginning, I felt I couldn’t live this way
To debase myself for the sake of your society
I blame your vain deceits for I’ve seen the plain hypocrisy
Of concealing my thoughts to gain security*
( — **S. The Pulse of Awakening:** *Electronegative*)

**Directionless, we stand alone**. We have squandered the freedom and opportunities that liberalism accorded us. Yet its victory should not be taken lightly. The answer to our identity-less division is not a return to tradition, but the exploration of new possibilities. Liberation from town, mono-culture, and king is priceless. Even as we pay the costs profusely.

*We are destined to be exploitable products
To emulate cheap happiness, like zealots we imitate
We do our part, secluded in vain deceptions
But soon glory fades and there is nothing left but suffering*
( — **S. The Pulse of Awakening:** *Nomenklatura*)

*Disconnected we have no goal or meaning to lead our steps on this floor
Like mannequins we’re evolving in the fields of a dead reality
Surrounded by our own delusions, fractured and distorted to the core
We’re searching the ecstasy of faith in this masquerade called life
As we stand alone, separated*
( — **S. Antares:** *Plasmaterial*)

**How do we live without shame**? Whether through dedication to family units or careers, distraction is the norm. 24/7 infotainment rules the day. We stay placated through our own lack of ambition foremost, but institutional controlguards prey on those who dare pass through the veil of security. Needlessly we relent. Secure in the delusion that systems work themselves out: We’ve succumbed to our fear of change.

*Relentless rules improved to increased control
Brutal enforcement to break disorder
They bring the strain of full security
A world of disabused norms*
( — **S. Antares:** *Technocracy*)

**Power is the enemy**. History was stolen from us by unimaginative power addicts who would sooner destroy the world than release it from their control. What a sickening neurosis: to feed their own insecurity with the blood of fellow beings. At every stage of our development, it was possible to live in relative prosperity with few hours of labour required to meet our needs. All the excesses of abuse and wealth served only to feed the egos of those who’d lift themselves above others. Love, culture, and mutual discovery were suppressed in favour of vain delusions: for ***glory***.

*Death is all around me
Blood is why we lick their feet
All celebrate the reigns of pigs
Leisure and atrocity*
( — **S. Antares:** *Twelve Megatons Gravity*)

*You believe in nothing but violence
And domination as the apex of our role
You won’t let anyone pass over the diving line
Until we drift apart*
( — **SD. Digital Divide:** *Shadow Domain*)

**The dearth of authenticity leaves us sick**. Decadent and unashamed, we reek of lifetimes wasted wearing masks upon masks. In consequence existence itself feels devitalized. We live afraid of authority figures; our peers; our dreams; ourselves. Circularly reinforcing falsehoods to construct our ‘manifest destiny’. Such as it is. Expression is kept under close watch for the sake of ***order***. Yet what value does ***order*** possess when its fruits are merely a regulated variety of ***chaos***? Anarchy is mistrusted while the ***anarchy*** of power elites reigns unchecked.

We are so sick to live this way, but we enjoy the lack of light
Walking in darkness to run away…
The blindness to cure all mind from dreadful misery
( — **S. Antares:** *Plasmaterial*)

**Our sentence; our way forward**. A vial of pessimism is healthy to ingest every once in a while. Do not make this your only fuel for spiritual sustenance lest you become sick and useless. Civilizations are built on inescapable destruction and creation cycles, this much is true. Through destruction, decay, and loss new opportunities for change are born. These are however patterns of potential only: As individuals we rightly feel powerless to effect change. Do not become consumed with the poison of hope lest you fall to an even more toxic pessimism. Everything is in flux. Yet the cosmic dice were cast long ago. In surrendering to the cold fatalism of chance we may yet defy the tyrannous stars.

*I vanish, purified, and escape through decay
All I could do will never clear the veil before your eyes
Wrapping the constrained mind into a shape of fear
There’s no more way to reverse destiny or destroy reality*
( — **S. Antares:** *Dynamic*)

*Empires keep on falling
No one can stop
The earth to keep on turning by the way
No need to try to fight it
Just wait and see
The virtuous liars won’t forever win*
( — **S. The Pulse of Awakening:** *Human Black Box*)
